GUI Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page
Instructor: Wenjin Zhou
Description: This file contains all of the HTML elements for my webpage. The webpage
serves as a place to talk about myself and my interestes and demo a few of my recent
projects. The purpose of this assignment is to create a webpage using only HTML and CSS.
The key features of this page are the Graphics demo (where you can play around with a
project I had to do for a previous course) and the GuessWord section (where I demonstrate
an app I made.)

                    to talk about myself, some recent schoolwork I've done, and some other links you can check out as

        <div class="text-container">
            <p>
                As senior computer science student, and I enjoy programming and working on software. I will be earning
                my Bachelor's Degree in December. I am also a musician, I have been playing guitar for over 10 years and
                have a two-year degree in Music Performance from Middlesex Community College.
            </p>

            <p>
                I like to think I have a wide variety of interests and hobbies. I enjoy playing video games, gardening,
                cooking, brewing coffee, recording music, and traveling any opportunity I get. Hopefully, I can get to a
                place in my life where I have the time and money to indulge in these hobbies more. Someday, I'd like to
                have a space in my home dedicated to playing and recording music.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a lot of things I want to do after I graduate. For instance, I want to learn more about
                electrical engineering and circuitry, not only to make myself a better computer scientist, but to be
                able to build gadgets and fun stuff. For instance, I'd like to build my own guitar effect pedals. I'd
                also like to build a retro gaming console as well, using a Raspberry Pi running game emulators. Oh, I
                also want to get into nature photography. Particularly birds. I like birds.
            </p>

            <p>
                See some of my recent schoolwork below.

        <!-- GRAPHICS PARAGRAPHS -->
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Computer Graphics I (COMP.4270) was a class I took in the Spring semester of 2023. This was a really
                interesting and challenging class that teaches fundamental concepts of the computer graphics pipeline
                using a graphics library called WebGL. Below is one of the homework assignments for that course. This
                purpose of this assignment was to program the camera controls for an object in a scene. You can use the
                controls below to change the position and movement of the camera. You can change the camera to either
                rotate along the edge of a sphere facing the sphere's origin, or to travel along a line given the
                line's endpoints.</p>

            <p>
                To switch between the sphere and the line camera, use the 'Perspective" selection box. When the sphere
                option is chosen, you can set the origin of the sphere using the X, Y, Z, numeric entries, as well as
                the radius. When the line option is chosen, you can define the endpoints of the line using the numeric
                entries that appear. For both options, you can toggle the animation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please note that in WebGL, the canvas has a 3D coordinate system ranging from -1 to 1, so setting the
                camera to a position outside of that range will cause the object or the camera to clip out of view.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, just for fun, I made it so the colors of each face of the object are randomized on page load.

        <!-- GUESSWORD INTRO PARAGRAPH -->
        <div class="text-container">
            "GuessWord" is the name of the Android app that I developed for Mobile App Programming II (COMP.4631) in the
            Spring semester of 2023. The purpose of this course is to come up with an idea for an app that we wish to
            create, and then develop and launch it. GuessWord is a game for Android devices that is similar to the New
            York Times' Wordle, except with a handful of additional features. For instance, Wordle is a once-a-day game,
            where you guess a five-letter word. In GuessWord, there is no limit to the amount of games you can play in a
            day, and you can also play games of other word-lengths, instead of only five-letter words. Check out some
            more features of GuessWord below.

                    <h3>Unlimited Play</h3>
                    <p>Unlike Wordle, GuessWord can be played unlimited times per day.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Complete randomly-generated daily challenges.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature">
                    <img src="images/screenshot3.jpg" alt="Check Your Stats">
                    <h3>Check Your Stats</h3>
                    <p>View stats and score information as you complete games and beat your personal high score.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature">
                    <img src="images/screenshot4.jpg" alt="View Your History">
                    <h3>View Your History</h3>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Overall, I'm quite proud of this app. If I had more time during the semester I was working on it, I would
                improve the UI with some animations and more customization options. I'm quite satisfied with the fact
                that I created a game I wanted to play, and now I play it nearly every day.</p>

            <p>I have made this game fully open-source, and you can find the source code, as well as the APK (Android
                installation) file <a href="https://github.com/jacoba-nelson/GuessWord">here</a>.</p>

                            image-generating models were in infancy about a year ago, it was interesting to give it
                            strange prompts and get a weird dreamy result. I have some videos where an AI image is being
                            generated over some simple music I made. As a side note, I must assert that AI art is truly
                            no match for
                            human-made art, and never will be. Support real artists and commission them in your work
