HW5 REPORT

This program allows the user to play a one-line game of scrabble. The user can drag the tiles from the tile holder to the board, and when the user presses "Check," if the tile are consecutively placed, the user earns points which adds to their score. The tiles are then replenished to their hand so they always have 7 tiles, until the user runs out of tiles. The amounts and values of the Scrabble tiles are the same as in actual Scrabble. Furthermore, the board has bonus squares which affect the score of the word appropriately.

I have all of the required features (as described by HW5.pdf) working properly. The only thing I did not include was the Blank Tile. The most challenging aspect of this assignment was the implementing the drag-and-drop functionality. However, there are lots of examples of jQuery drag-and-drop on the internet, so it was easy to learn from these examples and reading the documentation.
